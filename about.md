title: About Daniel
---

I'm just your average political science major turned electronic music composer turned data guy. 

I'm currently the Chief Data Evangelist for [Looker](http://www.looker.com). I love thinking about how data can shed light on hard problems, how to use data well, and how to teach analytics. I believe that everyone should be empowered to explore and analyze data, and that Looker makes that possible like nothing before.

Before Looker, I was Head of Data and Analytics at [Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com), using data to grow Upworthy's audience and get people to pay attention to the stories that really matter.

I worked at [MoveOn.org](http://www.moveon.org) from 2005 to 2012, holding positions in all areas of MoveOn's work and learning a ton about   analytics and optimization, online organizing, fundraising, and economic messaging.

Some other facts about me:

* I speak frequently, on panels at eMetrics, the Big Data Innovation Summit, Rootscamp, and Yale Law School and am a frequent trainer in statistics and analytics.
* I've appeared in all kinds of media,  from NPR's All Things Considered to MSNBC's The Last Word to The New York Times and The Washington Post.
* I received my bachelor's degree in Music and Political Science from Rutgers University and my master's degree in Multimedia Engineering from UC Santa Barbara's Media Arts and Technology program. 
* I live in Brooklyn with my wife, daughter, and a giant white dog.
* I'm an avid photographer and bread baker (or at least, I used to be and my wife would love for me to resume the hobby).

Thanks for reading!
